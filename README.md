# William Desa — Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site highlights my
experience, projects, and technical skills as I pursue data science opportunities.

## 🧭 Structure

- `index.html` – semantic HTML layout that powers the single-page portfolio experience.
- `styles.css` – responsive styling with a dark, data-inspired visual theme.
- `script.js` – lightweight JavaScript for interactive project filtering and navigation behavior.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Clone the repository and open the project folder.
2. Serve the site locally with your preferred static file server (for example `python -m http.server`).
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to explore the portfolio.

## 📂 Where to find everything

- The production-ready site is the `index.html` file in the repository root.
- Styling lives in `styles.css` and interactive behaviour in `script.js`—there is no build step.
- All assets load locally, so you can zip this folder or deploy it directly to any static host.

## ☁️ Ship it to GitHub Pages

1. Commit your changes and push to the `main` branch of your fork or repository.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages** and set the source to `Deploy from a branch` with `main` and `/ (root)`.
3. Save to publish. GitHub will serve the portfolio at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
