# William Desa â€” Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site highlights my
experience, projects, and technical skills as I pursue data science opportunities.

## ðŸ§­ Structure

- `index.html` â€“ semantic HTML layout that powers the single-page portfolio experience.
- `styles.css` â€“ responsive styling with a dark, data-inspired visual theme.
- `script.js` â€“ lightweight JavaScript for interactive project filtering and navigation behavior.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

1. Clone the repository and open the project folder.
2. Serve the site locally with your preferred static file server (for example `python -m http.server`).
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to explore the portfolio.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Hero section highlighting contact details and resume-backed impact metrics.
- Filterable project gallery covering machine learning, analytics, and data engineering initiatives.
